## About

The Z-Wave JS UI add-on provides an additional control panel, allowing you
to configure every aspect of your Z-Wave network. It provides a decoupled
gateway which can communicate using Z-Wave JS WebSockets (used by the
Vioneta Agro Z-Wave JS integration) and MQTT (even simultaneously).

Some advantages and use-cases:

- Compatible with the Vioneta Agro Z-Wave JS integration.
- Your Z-Wave network will keep running between Vioneta Agro restarts.
- You can directly use things like Node-RED with your Z-Wave network, while
  it is available for Vioneta Agro at the same time.
- Allow [ESPHome.io][esphome] based ESP devices to directly respond or work
  with your Z-Wave network.
- Pre-configures itself with the Mosquitto add-on when found.

This add-on uses the [Z-Wave JS UI][zwave-js-ui] software.
